# README

The Sipeed Tang Nano is a board with a small GOWIN FPGA that costs less than $5.

[This site](http://xesscorp.githuio/tanng_nano_user) will record my experiences as I explore the uses of tthis board.
I don't intend this as a tutorial on using FPGAs: there are
plenty of those already and I'll reference them as needed.
Rather, I'll use these posts to tamp the things I learn about the Tang Nano board and its GOWIN FPGA into my
own head.
As such, I'll create blog posts describing my experiments and I'll store
the design files in the Github repository.
Feel free to use them as they become available: everything is open source.
