Here's the story.
[GOWIN Semiconductor](https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/) made some [low-cost FPGAs](https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/product/detail/2/).
Then [Sipeed](https://www.sipeed.com/) used them to produce an inexpensive development board.
At $5, the [Tang Nano FPGA board](https://www.cnx-software.com/2019/10/15/5-tang-nano-fpga-board-gowin-gw1n-littlebee-fpga/)
promises to open the use of FPGAs to a much
wider audience interested in much weirder applications, similar to what the ESP8266 chip did for WiFi applications.
After all, you'd think twice about doing something crazy with a $100 board,
but burning-up a Nano isn't a big deal.
One day soon maybe we'll all have Pez dispensers full of Nano boards
for building our hardware.

But before we can get there, we need to know how to use the Nano.
I don't intend this site as a generic tutorial on what FPGAs are and how to use them: there are
already plenty of [those](http://www.xess.com/static/media/appnotes/FpgasNowWhatBook.pdf).
Rather, I'm interested in doing specific projects with the Nano which others can
grab and modify for their own uses.
As such, I'll create posts describing my experiments and I'll store
the design files in the [Github repository](https://www.github.com/devbisme/tang_nano_user).
Feel free to use them as they become available: everything is covered under open source licenses.

Onward!
