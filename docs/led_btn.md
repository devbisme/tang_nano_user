I hate making videos.
I hate making programming videos even more.

Naturally, I had to make [one](https://youtu.be/F5hlv3XTcO0).

To be fair, the GOWIN software is GUI-based, so a video on how to use it
to create a [simple LED + pushbutton FPGA design](https://github.com/xesscorp/tang_nano_user/tree/master/projects/led_btn)
makes *some* sense.
But this video will age badly as the software developers move menu items
around and introduce new icons and dialog screens, *because that's what
they do!*
For now (December, 2019), though, it's a good starting point for familiarizing
yourself with the GOWIN FPGA design flow for the Nano board.

So, "enjoy".
