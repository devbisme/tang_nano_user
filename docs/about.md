I've worked with FPGAs since the '80s, but nothing with the low price of the Tang Nano.
I think this board will open the use of FPGAs to a much wider audience, and I hope this
site makes their journey a little easier.

I don't intend this as a generic tutorial on what FPGAs are and how to use them: there are
plenty of [those](http://www.xess.com/static/media/appnotes/FpgasNowWhatBook.pdf).
Rather, I'm interested in doing specific projects with the Tang Nano board which others can
grab and modify for their own uses.

My thanks to GOWIN Semiconductor for making their low-cost FPGAs, and Sipeed for
producing an equally inexpensive development board.
Their actions led to the creation of this site, but all the content is mine.
