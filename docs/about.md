I've worked with FPGAs since the '80s, but nothing with the low price of the Tang Nano board.
I think this board will open the use of FPGAs to a much wider audience, and I hope this
site makes their journey a little easier.

I don't intend this as a generic tutorial on what FPGAs are and how to use them: there are
plenty of those already and I'll reference them as needed.
Rather, I'm interested in doing specific projects with the Tang Nano board which others can
grab and modify for their own uses.

My thanks to GOWIN Semiconductor for making their low-cost FPGAs, and Sipeed for
producing an equally inexpensive development board.
They are indirectly to blame for the creation of this site, but not for any of its contents.
